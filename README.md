# Is *SEC Speed* a real thing?

If you've watched college football over the past 10-ish years, you've likely heard the phrase "SEC Speed" come through your soundbar (most likely from Gary Danielson as Alabama is blowing some poor team's doors off). This topic [hasn't been covered](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/482339-debunking-the-myth-of-sec-speed-is-the-sec-really-faster-than-the-competition) for a while now, and given the SEC's recent run of dominance in the sport, I thought it might be time to revisit.






Below are the average 40-yard times for eeach conference at the combine:
